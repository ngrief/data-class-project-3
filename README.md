# Project Overview and Purpose
## Research Question and Terminology
*Is there a relationship between the population density of a country and its migration trends?*

**Net Migration Rate** is "[t]he difference between the number of migrants entering and those leaving a country in a year, per 1,000 midyear population. May also be expressed in percent. A positive figure is known as a net immigration rate and a negative figure as a net emigration rate" [(Census.gov)](https://www.census.gov/glossary/?term=Net+migration+rate).

- A formula for calculating the net migration rate is:
- N = (I - E) / M X 1,000
  - N = Net migration rate
  - I = Number of immigrants entering the area
  - E = Number of emigrants leaving the area
  - M = Mid-year population

Source: [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_migration_rate#:~:text=The%20net%20migration%20rate%20is,positive%20net%20migration%20rate%20occurs.)
    
Note: Our original dataset did not multiply the migration percentage by 1,000 (to reflect per 1,000 people) so that was a step added to the JavaScript.

**Population Density** is how many people live in a given area.

## Methodology and Tools
- JavaScript, Leaflet, HTML, CSS, Chart.js
- ETL: CSV, MongoDB

## Results
- Visualizations
- Dashboards
